# Local DevOps Pipeline

## Overview

A comprehensive full-stack local DevOps project demonstrating modern software development and deployment practices. This project showcases a complete CI/CD pipeline with containerized applications, orchestration, and monitoring capabilities, all designed to run in a local development environment.

## Project Architecture

This project implements a production-grade DevOps workflow featuring:

- **Frontend Application**: Modern web interface for user interaction
- **Python Backend**: RESTful API services built with Python frameworks
- **Database Layer**: Persistent data storage with containerized databases
- **CI/CD Automation**: Automated build, test, and deployment workflows
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes manifests for scalable deployment
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Integrated monitoring stack for application insights

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python (Flask/FastAPI)
- **Frontend**: React/Vue.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL/MongoDB
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (k3s/minikube)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions / Jenkins
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Version Control**: Git

## Directory Purpose

### `/frontend`
Contains the frontend application with modern JavaScript frameworks, component libraries, and static assets.

### `/backend`
Python-based backend services including API endpoints, business logic, authentication, and data processing modules.

### `/db`
Database schemas, migration scripts, seed data, and database configuration files.

### `/.github/workflows`
CI/CD pipeline configurations including automated testing, linting, building, and deployment workflows.

### `/k8s`
Kubernetes manifests for deploying applications including deployments, services, configmaps, secrets, and ingress rules.

### `/monitoring`
Monitoring stack configurations including Prometheus rules, Grafana dashboards, and alerting configurations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Kubernetes (minikube, k3s, or Docker Desktop with Kubernetes)
- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 16+
- kubectl CLI

### Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Srinivasbanda11/local-devops-pipeline.git
   cd local-devops-pipeline
   ```

2. Set up the backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development environment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
